- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sabina
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in maths, lca and sustainable fashion
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot on uncertainty in lca
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: honestly, the best way is probably my instagram @sabinkabednar, but my email bednsa@gmail.com is also pretty great
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her, they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: my last name means Cooper in English, so in theory, my intials are the same as Sheldon Cooper's (apart from the obvious same last name)
